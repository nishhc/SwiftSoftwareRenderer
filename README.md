# Swift Raycast Renderer

A simple Swift-based raycasting engine for rendering 2D maps in a first-person perspective, inspired by classic raycasting engines like those used in early 3D games (Wolfenstein 3D).

Features an entirely custom drawing an raycasting engine utilizing CoreGraphics. The intended purpose of the app is to teach how raycasting is performed and how it was used to create games. The current app allows for toggles that turn on the 3D Projection, 2D Map Rendering, and 2D Raycast Visualization.

App is INCOMPLETE. AI-generated paragraphs have been used as a placeholder for the tabs on the left. Those will be filled with the history of Raycasting's implementation and how it works.
